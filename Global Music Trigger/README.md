# Jester SQF Tuts\Global Music Trigger

Author: Dolan

Firstly obtain the audio that you wish to use in a mission, then make sure to *CONVERT THE FILE INTO A .OGG FILE*, this can be done via a program like Audacity.

Launch your mission in the ARMA Editor. In the top left of your screen, click "Scenario > Open Scenario Folder"

Your mission directory will open, right click and hover over "New > Folder" name this folder "music" (make sure it has a lowercase "m")

Put your audio file in the new "music" folder you just created, rename it to "intro.ogg"

Repeat the last step if you have multiple music files for your mission, hypothetically my mission will have 4 music files, so I'll have the files named "intro.ogg, intro2.ogg, intro3.ogg, intro4.ogg 

Download the "description.ext" provided, place it in your Scenario Folder (this can be found via "Scenario > Open Scenario Folder" in Arma 3 if you forgot)

Alt-Tab back into Arma 3, hit Ctrl + S to save your mission, this allows Arma to see what changes you just did.

Place a trigger via pressing the flag icon near the upper right side of your screen or by pressing F3, click any of the triggers.

Double click the trigger you just placed, in the trigger transformation tab, change the size of the trigger to what you desire.

Set the Activation to "Any Player" (you can use any type you want, but for simplicity lets go with this one)

Scroll down, to "Trigger: Effects", select "Music", and change it to "01" (you'll need to change it to "02" if this is your second piece of music you're putting it, and "03" for the second piece of music etc etc,)

You're done, enjoy.
